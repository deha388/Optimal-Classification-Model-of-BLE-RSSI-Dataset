# OPTIMAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL OF BLE RSSI DATASET FOR INDOOR LOCALIZATION AND NAVIGATION

### Project Overview
The aim of the project is to develop optimal classifiers to predict the position of the user based on the RSSI readings from thirteen iBeacon devices. The BLE RSSI labeled dataset was used to train different classifiers and evaluate their performance.

### Motivation

The motivation for the project is to develop big data analysis tool for smart cities and help people guide indoors using machine learning approach.\
